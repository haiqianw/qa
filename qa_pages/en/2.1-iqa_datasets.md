A list of state-of-the-art image quality assessment methods and datasets. 

According to the availability of the whole or partial original undistorted image (often called reference image), image quality assessment (IQA) methods are typically divided into three categories as follows: 1) full-reference IQA (FR-IQA), 2) reduced-reference IQA (RR-IQA), and 3) no-reference IQA (NR-IQA).
